# Airbnb-Athens-Rental-Exercise

This exercise is a Tableau-based BI scenario using Airbnb listing data for Athens, Greece. The objective is to support a rental/investment decision process by turning raw listing data into clear visuals that answer two core questions:
1) What is the average price per night in each neighbourhood?
2) Where are the highest concentrations of currently-available rentals across the city?


The [activity](https://github.com/johngod194/Google-Business-Intelligence-Course/blob/7915b60fe1ff4a7f09e7467a09892cf5b176187a/Exercices/Airbnb%20-%20Athens%20Rental/Activity%20Overview.pdf) follows three practical stages:
- **Data collection, preparation & processing:** Collect, prepare and process [dataset](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1O55Ka9iDLTFxUjcED3reGDJQMsFsGzzC/view?usp=sharing) - handle missing/invalid values, and clean data so aggregations (like average price) are reliable and load the dataset into Tableau, validate schema and field types (price, neighbourhood, geo fields).
- **Chart development:** Build visuals that compare neighbourhoods by average nightly price and summarise availability patterns (sorting, labels, and simple filters to make insights easy to scan).
- **Dashboard development (Tableau):** Add a map to show the geographic concentration of available rentals and combine all views into a single dashboard designed for quick neighbourhood comparison and location-based insight.
