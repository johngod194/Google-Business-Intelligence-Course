# Cyclistic-Summary
This repository summarises the **Cyclistic Business Intelligence Capstone** from the Google BI course on Coursera. The case focuses on analysing **Focus on understanding how their customers are using their bikes** and building a BI deliverable that helps stakeholders understand **identifying customer demand at different station locations** and how performance changes over time.

The project is split into three case studies:
- [**Case 1 - Requirements & Planning:**](https://github.com/johngod194/Google-Business-Intelligence-Course/blob/494b2c25078322e8903774d554977f32386c1da2/Projects/Cyclistic%20Business%20Intelligence%20Project/Case%20Scenario%20Overview/Cyclistic%20-%20Case%201%20Overview.pdf) Define stakeholder needs and success criteria by completing the Stakeholder Requirements, Project Requirements, and Strategy documents.
- [**Case 2 - Data collection and Data Cleaning:**](https://github.com/johngod194/Google-Business-Intelligence-Course/blob/494b2c25078322e8903774d554977f32386c1da2/Projects/Cyclistic%20Business%20Intelligence%20Project/Case%20Scenario%20Overview/Cyclistic%20-%20Case%202%20Overview.pdf) Collected and processed data from three data sets:

- [**Case 3 - Dashboard Development:**](https://github.com/johngod194/Google-Business-Intelligence-Course/blob/494b2c25078322e8903774d554977f32386c1da2/Projects/Cyclistic%20Business%20Intelligence%20Project/Case%20Scenario%20Overview/Cyclistic%20-%20Case%203%20Overview.pdf) Design and build a Tableau dashboard to visualise Summer Trends, Seasonality and Top Trips using Cyclistic matching stakeholder expectations.
