# Google Business Intelligence Course Portfolio

This repository contains my work from the Google Business Intelligence Certificate on Coursera. The course focuses on building practical BI skills across the end to end workflow:
understanding stakeholder needs, defining KPIs, preparing and modelling data, and delivering dashboards and reports that support decision making.

Core tools and methods covered include SQL and BigQuery for data preparation and Tableau for dashboard design and reporting.
